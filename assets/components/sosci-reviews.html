    <p class="review-text">I've not tried osci-render premium yet, but sosci is the best software oscilloscope I've ever used, and I've used quite a few! It looks great, it's highly customisable, and it has super-simple record/video export functionality. Well worth the price. (EDIT: Asked about a VST version/floating window, turns out this already exists!)</p>

    <p class="review-text">Looks incredible, offers so much variety of styles, no hassle with a screen recorder due to the recording feature, and includes a VST so you can see exactly how your final production will look on the fly. It's everything you could ever want a software oscilloscope to be!</p>

    <p class="review-text">OMG this is the best! I've been looking for exactly this for years, and I was going to buy expensive hardware. This works in my DAW or standalone and is perfect for light and sound shows. THANK YOU!!</p>

    <p class="review-text">Hands down, the best software replication of a hardware oscilloscope on the market. The accessibility features for adjusting the display settings AND Lua compatible live coding, I'm in love with this software. ðŸ¥° Thank you James!</p>
