    <p class="review-text">I couldn't get some of the features working at first, but the
        support I received was amazing. The developers were super patient and even sent
        me unreleased files just because I asked! They walked me through everything with
        step-by-step instructions. It really feels like they care about their users. Big
        thanks to the teamâ€”this app and the support behind it are next-level!</p>

    <p class="review-text">I've been using oscirender since almost a year now, both for
        live and artwork, and it has proven again and again to be a fantastic tool, that
        keeps getting better with each version. I really recommend give it a go and try
        by yourself, not gonna regret it</p>

    <p class="review-text">I started out completely blind, knowing nothing about this
        art form, and when I finally got the hang of if I realized how insane this
        plugin is, it's blowing my mind every time I play around with it. The fact that
        you can load almost anything makes it extra fun, you can create inane stuff with
        it. The second I have some extra money I wanna buy the sosci!</p>
